The following is a list of requirements that an application must meet in order
to be added to the benchmark suite. Here "target" is the application in question.

This is a work in progress and input from the community is much welcomed.

1. target is a real world (i.e., it is an artifact of an actual active software project).
2. target has numerous vulnerabilities that are all in a given version
3. target has numerous vulnerabilities that are all reachable via the same command line arguments
4. for each of the vulnerabilities, there exist PoC sample input file(s) that trigger crash
5. target's vulns have associated CVEs (or at least a bug tracking system to reference)
6. target adds some variety of depth or complexity to existing suite
7. targets vary in terms of input -- e.g. well-structured, types of data (image vs sound)
