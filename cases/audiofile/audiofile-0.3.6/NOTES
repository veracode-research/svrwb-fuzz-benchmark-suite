Audio File Library 0.3.6
Development Notes
Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

----

Large file support is now enabled by default on all systems.  This change
has no effect on systems where off_t is always 64 bits (e.g. IRIX,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X).

Many compressed data formats are not supported.  This is currently the
most important issue to address.

Error handling is at the present quite robust, but more work can always
be done in this area.

SGI's Audio File Library on IRIX implements the following formats which
this version of the library does not:

	MPEG1 audio bitstream
	Sound Designer II
	SoundFont2

I plan to implement some of these as time permits.  Sound Designer
II is out of the question because of its dependency upon Macintosh
resource forks.  Handling these files on Unix systems is simply not
worth the effort.

This version of the Audio File Library has been tested under the following
operating environments:

	i686-pc-linux-gnu / Ubuntu 12.10 (gcc 4.7.2)
	x86_64-pc-linux-gnu / Ubuntu 12.10 (gcc 4.7.2)
	x86_64-pc-linux-gnu / Ubuntu 12.10 (clang 3.0)
	armv6l-raspberrypi-linux-gnueabihf / Raspbian Wheezy (gcc 4.6.3)
	i386-apple-darwin10.8.0 / Mac OS X 10.6.8 (gcc 4.2.1)
	x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 / Mac OS X 10.6.8 (gcc 4.2.1)
	i386-pc-freebsd9.1 / FreeBSD 9.1 (gcc 4.2.1)
	sparc64-sun-freebsd9.1 / FreeBSD 9.1 (gcc 4.2.1)
