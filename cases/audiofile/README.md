## Source

[https://github.com/mpruett/audiofile/](https://github.com/mpruett/audiofile/)

The repo has tags for versions.


## Two possible apps here

There is the `sfconvert` and the `sfinfo` tools. Both have some bugs, but *seems*
sfconvert has more currently known. It is the one described in `bugs.json`. However
there is a `bugs_sfinfo.json` file for the other.
